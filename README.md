Functions should go into DATAPACK_NAME_HERE/functions, NOT minecraft/functions
Powers should go into your power library


Example:

Functions go into:
datapacks/examplepack/data/example/functions/

Powers go into:
datapacks/examplepack/data/example/pwoers


MAKE SURE TO ADD YOUR POWERS INTO YOUR ORIGIN!!!
